# babel-config-clone (cli)

Use the same `babel-config.js` file for most if not all projects? Me too, so why have it under source control for each individual project.
The goal of this project is to copy the `babel-config.js` from this project to whatever consuming projects root.

## How to use

Run the cli, `yarn js-common-babel-config-clone`. Now you have a `babel.config.js` file.
