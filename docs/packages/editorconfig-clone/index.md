# editorconfig-clone (cli)

TLDR: Copies .editorconfig.

Use the same `.editorconfig` file for most if not all projects? Me too, so why have it under source control for each individual project.
The goal of this project is to copy the `.editorconfig` from this project to whatever consuming projects root.

## How to use

Run the cli, `yarn js-common-editorconfig-clone`. Now you have a `.editorconfig` file.
